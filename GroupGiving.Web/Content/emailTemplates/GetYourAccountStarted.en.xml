Thanks for making a pledge with TicketMuffin - we're really glad to have you on board.

We'd just like to ask you for a little personal information - your name, for instance, so we can be polite and address any emails we send to you personally.

If you have a spare minure, we'd be grateful if you click or copy/past this url into your browser:

http://www.ticketmuffin.com/account/get-started/@Model.Account.PasswordResetToken

On that page you can tell us a little about yourself. Don't worry, all the information is optional and totally private.

Regards,
